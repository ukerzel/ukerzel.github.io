Deep learning and Artificial Intelligence have the potential to enable new frontier in materials science. In my talk at the (virtual) TMS 2021 we explore how deep learning can enable statistical analysis of demage mechanisms in dual-phase steel.
There is a [YouTube recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E0TDKJSRBY) and the [slides](assets/Kerzel_DeepLearningCharacterization_TMS2021.pdf)
