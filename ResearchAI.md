# Data Science and Artificial Intelligence

As the field of Data Science matures, we need to define a standard approach how to implement Data Science and AI projects in practice.

The DASC-PM model defines a standard approach for data science projects, read the full paper here [DASC-PM v.1.0 - Ein Vorgehensmodell f√ºr Data-Science-Projekte](https://www.iubh-university.de/wp-content/uploads/20200220_DASC-PM.pdf) (in German)

Companies in particular face many challenges implementing AI in their organization. In many cases, technical infrastructure and talent are major hurdles but even if these are available, organizational and business aspects are even more challening in practical applications. Identifying suitable use-cases is of critical importance for companies to derive value from AI. The "Enterprise AI Canvas" [Journal](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08839514.2020.1826146) [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11190) offers a structured approach and guidance how to start an AI project in a company.
