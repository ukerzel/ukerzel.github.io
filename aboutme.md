Hi, I'm Ulrich Kerzel and am Professor for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at [IUBH](https://www.iubh-fernstudium.de/), where I am the director of the [Master in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.iubh-fernstudium.de/master/masterstudiengaenge/it-und-technik/artificial-intelligence/).

My current research is focused on AI in materials research in cooperation with [IMM RWTH Aaachen](https://www.imm.rwth-aachen.de/index.php?id=2&L=1), helping companies to create value using AI and am part of the research group [AI in education](https://ai-in-education.de/) at IUBH.
Recently, we have started a new project about digitalization in education [EduC Kompass Digitale Bildung](https://www.iubh-university.de/forschung/educ-kompass-digitale-bildung/)

Before joininig IUBH I was with

- [Blue Yonder](blueyonder.com) where I was head of the Data Science Academy, lead the machine learning development team and lead and worked on various customer projects.
- [CERN](cern.ch) As a Research Fellow, I worked on the trigger for the [LHCb](http://lhcb.web.cern.ch/) experiment and searched for new physics in the decay of B_s mesons decaying into two kaons.
- [Cavendish HEP group](https://www.hep.phy.cam.ac.uk/) where I worked on the [RICH detector](https://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/en/Detector/RICH-en.html) for the [LHCb](http://lhcb.web.cern.ch/) and searched for new physics in the decay of B_s mesons decaying into two kaons.
- [Magdalene College](https://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/) in Cambridge where I was a Senior Research Fellow.
- [Trinity Hall](https://www.trinhall.cam.ac.uk/) in Cambridge where I was a postdoctoral research associate.
- [Institut f√ºr Experimentelle Teilchenphysik](https://www.etp.kit.edu/) at KIT where I did my PhD in particle physics and my undergraduate studies at KIT.
