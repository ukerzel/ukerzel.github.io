# Education & Background

My [PhD thesis](assets/phdthesis_kerzel.pdf) at KIT was focused on Grid Computing and the X(3872) particle. Grid computing is the academic predecessor to modern cloud computing, tailored towards fundamental research. Around the year 2000, we already handled peta-bytes of data, developing global systems like [SAM](https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/sam/wiki) at [FermiLab](https://www.fnal.gov/) to enable distributed neural network analysis.
